I don't know what this project will become, but I'm will practice my react skills in this project.


The lasts steps was add the open-props and the postcss plugins.

## Running the project

Fist make a fork of this repo and then on the folder:


```sh
npm install
```

and run any of this scripts:


```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },                            

```
```sh
npm run YourScript
```
